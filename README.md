This is an example how to turn a PMS5003 sensor on/off before/after readings to extend its lifetime in a Enviro for Raspberry Pi project.
The PMS5003 sensor uses laser technology to measure the concentration of particulate matter in the air.
This laser light supposed to have a life span of 30.000 hours, which is about 3.5 years.
A solution to extend the life span of the PMS5003 is to turn it on and off between readings.
